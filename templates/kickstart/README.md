## Development

> This manual covers development of visual styles. To learn more about Subrion template structure and configuration options, please refer to Subrion Extensions wiki page: `URL_TO_SUBRION_WIKI`

The Kickstart template is setup to use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to compile LESS (with source maps), run it through [AutoPrefixr](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), optimize images, and syncs changes across local development devices with [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/docs/gulp/), with flexibility to add any additional tasks via the Gulpfile. Alternatively, you can use [Prepros](https://prepros.io/) or whatever else y ou prefer to compile the LESS and manage the JavaScript.

### Prerequisites

In root folder of Kickstart template run:
```
npm i
```
To install all necessary node modules.

#### BrowserSync
Before running `dev` task, be sure to copy **config.sample.json** and rename it to **config.json**. Then change server config in **config.json** file for BrowserSync to work properly. Otherwise BrowserSync won't work.

### Tasks

```
gulp dev
```
Starts BrowserSync and watches for LESS files. Optimizes images and compiles LESS with SourceMaps.

```
gulp build
```
Compiles LESS and optimizes images.

### Template styles/elements page

```
http://yourdomain.com/?elements
```
